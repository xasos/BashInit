BashInit
========
## About
Simple bash script to create git repos directly from the command line.

### Note
I have discovered that GitHub has already integrated this feature with their [Hub command line tool](https://hub.github.com/). This tool extends the functionality of Git and makes working with it a lot easier (along with a slew of other features). :thumbsup:
