BashInit
========
## About
Simple bash script to create git repos directly from the command line.

## Post-Mortem
Don't use this script. I have discovered that GitHub has already integrated this feature with [Hub](https://hub.github.com/). This tool extends the functionality of Git and makes working with it a lot easier. :thumbsup:
